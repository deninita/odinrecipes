        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large eggplants</li>
            <li>2 to 4 tablespoons lemon juice, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup tahini or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>    
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place eggplant on the prepared baking sheet, and pierce holes in the skin with a fork. Roast in the preheated oven, turning occasionally, until very soft and tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Set eggplant aside until cool enough to handle; slice in half and scoop flesh into a colander or fine mesh sieve over a bowl; drain for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place eggplant, lemon juice, tahini, sesame seeds, and garlic in blender, and puree. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Transfer eggplant mixture to a medium size mixing bowl, and slowly mix in olive oil. Refrigerate the baba ghanoush for 3 hours before serving.</li>
